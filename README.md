## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to split the data into training and testing data, and then Create a Logistic Regression Model with that data. This data was information about each person who was lent money, our job was then to create a model that could identify "healthy" and "high-risk" loans. This could be done with a variety of different methods, the one used in this analysis being Logistic Regression.

## Results
- The Logistic Regression Model predicts '0' (healthy loan) perfectly, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 100%. The prediction of '1' (high-risk loans) is quite a bit worse, but still good with a precision, recall, and f1-score of around 88%.

## Summary
The Logistic Regression Model was quite effective in finding healthy and high-risk loans. It was slightly worse at identifying '1' over 0, and the '1' being the high-risk loan would be the data you want to identify. Overall, I would recommend this model.
